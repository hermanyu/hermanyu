# Welcom to Herman's Github

Hello! My name is Herman Yu and welcome to my github! Here you will find a portfolio of all of my data science, machine learning, and programming projects.


### About Me

I am a data scientist and primarily work on data science and machine learning problems. Originally, I was a mathematician by training but decided to pursue
a career in Data Science because of the interesting and hands-on problems being studied in the field. Advances in cloud computing and big data have also made 
it possible to solve problems with a data-driven approach.

### About This Github

On this github, you'll find most of my projects from major portfolio pieces to quick implementations of ML models on small and clean data sets.
My hope is to use this github as a library of knowledge I have encountered (and will encounter) on my data science journey. 

### Current Areas of Interest

Currently, I am primarily interested on in applications and implementations of neural networks. That being said, I don't believe deep learning is necessarily the go-to answer
for every class of machine learning problem. Therefore, another major area of interest for me is to develop a better understanding of cases where
classical ML models like Logistic Regression or ensemble tree methods are more resource-effective than deep learning models.

### Future Plans

In the future, I plan on learning SQL and doing a few projects involving database querying. I also plan on developing a more robust understanding of data structures and
may develope a few projects in Java.
