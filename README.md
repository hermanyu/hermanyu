# Welcom to Herman's Github

Hello! My name is Herman Yu and welcome to my github! Here you will find a portfolio of all of my data science, machine learning, and programming projects.


### About Me

I am a data scientist and primarily work on data science and machine learning problems. Originally, I was a mathematician by training but decided to pursue
a career in Data Science because of the interesting and hands-on problems being studied in the field. Advances in cloud computing and big data have also made 
it possible to solve problems with a data-driven approach.

I began my machine learning journey when I first saw face filters and facial recognition apps being deployed on smartphone technology. The fact that computer science and mathematics had evolved to the point where such an amazing feat could be performed in miliseconds on a  smart phone really inspired me to study machine learning problem.

### My Project Gala

Below is a select list of projects I've completed. I also plan on using this github for smaller, exercise-level projects so feel free to click around and look at some of my repos!
- <a href='https://github.com/hermanyu/hm-recommender'> H&M Recommender System and Dress Finder App </a>
- <a href='https://github.com/hermanyu/the-onion-classifier'> The Onion Classifier: Exploring Fake News Headline Detection Using NLP </a>.
- <a href='https://github.com/hermanyu/Intel-Image-Classification'> Intel's Image Classification Challenge: A 5-Hour Hack-a-thon </a>.
- <a href='https://github.com/hermanyu/LinDHA'> Linear Data Housing Appraiser (LinDHA) </a>.

### Personal Growth and Education
- <a href='https://github.com/hermanyu/PyTorch-Notes'> Learning PyTorch </a>
- <a href='https://github.com/hermanyu/R-Tutorial'> Learning R </a>

### Current Areas of Interest

My primary area of interest is the application of data science and machine learning to solve marketing challenges for B2B businesses. Some specific topics of interest and learning include recommender systems, user base segmentation, panel regression and econometric methods, and statistical/casual inferences for data analytics.

A secondary area of interest for me is data engineering and backend software development with the goal of eventually deploying web-based real-time ML applications and general DevOps/MLOps. Specific topics I am currently learning (or planning to in the near future) include OOP via Java, data structures/algorithms, x86 architecture and assembly language, shell scripting in Unix, and cloud solutions via Microsoft Azure.
