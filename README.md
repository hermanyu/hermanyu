# Welcom to Herman's Github

Hello! My name is Herman Yu and welcome to my github! Here you will find a portfolio of all of my data science, machine learning, and programming projects.


### About Me

I am a data scientist and primarily work on data science and machine learning problems. Originally, I was a mathematician by training but decided to pursue
a career in Data Science because of the interesting and hands-on problems being studied in the field. Advances in cloud computing and big data have also made 
it possible to solve problems with a data-driven approach.

I began my machine learning journey when I first saw face filters and facial recognition apps being deployed on smartphone technology. The fact that computer science and mathematics had evolved to the point where such an amazing feat could be performed in miliseconds on a  smart phone really inspired me to study machine learning problem.

### My Project Gala

Below is a select list of projects I've completed. I also plan on using this github for smaller, exercise-level projects so feel free to click around and look at some of my repos!

### Current Areas of Interest

Currently, I am primarily interested on in applications and implementations of neural networks. That being said, I don't believe deep learning is necessarily the go-to answer
for every class of machine learning problem. Therefore, another major area of interest for me is to develop a better understanding of cases where
classical ML models like Logistic Regression or ensemble tree methods are more resource-effective than deep learning models.

### Future Plans

In the future, I plan on learning SQL and doing a few projects involving database querying. I also plan on developing a more robust understanding of data structures and
may develope a few projects in Java.
